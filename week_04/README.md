Useful functions:

As a "math" person, I am particularly fond of eigen(),
because finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors by hand is 
horribly tedious.

The function x11() opens up a new window for a plot,
which can be nice for viewing images that aren't quite
so crammed into the little viewing window on R studio.

sample() is useful for selecting data, especially if you are doing training/testing or want a simulation.
