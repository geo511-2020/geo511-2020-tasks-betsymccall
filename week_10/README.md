The MODIS link on the website wasn't working when I tried it (got a 404 error), so I Googled for some additional information.  Found some of the following:
https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/multispectral-remote-sensing-modis/modis-data-in-R/
https://rspatial.org/terra/modis/index.html
https://rspatial.org/terra/modis/2-download.html

There is a lot here, but spectral data is a really common thing in images of space, so I'm somewhat familiar with its value in making composite images, false-color image to enhance features, and chemical signature detection.
